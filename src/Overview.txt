Subfolders:

Preprocessing/:
Scripts for:
    - CLAHE, Gaussian filtering
    - U-Net segmentation
    - Data augmentation (rotation, flipping, zoom)
- Outputs go to data/processed/.

 
Features/:
Extracts:
    - Morphological features (e.g., area, eccentricity)
    - Deep features via pretrained CNNs (e.g., ResNet50 embeddings)
- Outputs NumPy arrays or Pandas DataFrames.

Models/:
Contains:
    - CNN for classification
    - LSTM for time-series prediction
    - Attention modules
- Each model should be modularized (e.g., cnn.py, lstm.py).

Training/:
-Training loops using PyTorch or TensorFlow.
-Includes:
    - Loss functions (CrossEntropy, MSE)
    - Optimizers (AdamW)
    - Callbacks (early stopping, checkpointing)
- Reads from configs/.

Evaluation/:
- Scripts for:
    - Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
    - Confusion matrix
    - Grad-CAM visualization
- Outputs go to results/.

Deployment/:
- Inference scripts for new images.
- API endpoints (e.g., Flask/FastAPI).
- MongoDB integration for storing results.
- Dashboard logic (e.g., Streamlit, Dash).
